PRACTICAL 2 END

JOINTS- used to joint different types of table to compare the values of the tables

select instructor_id, name from instructor WHERE dept_id = (SELECT dept_id FROM DEPARTMENT WHERE name = 'Computer Science');
select i.instructor_id, i.name, i.salary, d.name from instructor I join Department d on i.dept_id=d.dept_id where d.name='Computer Science'
insert into instructor values(8,'xyv',1,'N',20000);
select i.instructor_id, i.name, i.salary, d.name from instructor I join Department d on i.dept_id=d.dept_id where d.name='Computer Science';

Practical 3-

1] find average of salary:
select avg(i.salary) as avg_salary from instructor I join department d on i.dept_id=d.dept_id where d.name='Computer Science';

2] average salary in each department:
select d.name as dept_name, avg(i.salary) as avg_salary from department D join Instructor I on d.dept_id=i.dept_id group by d.name;

3] total salary of all teachers earning more than 30k:
select sum(salary) as total from instructor where salary > 30000;

4,5] find name of all department whose building name include the substring "sci":
select * from department where lower(name) like '%sci%';
select * from department where lower(name) like '%mat%';

6] display length of name of all the students:
select length(name) as total_lenght from instructor;
select sum(length(name))  as total_lenght from instructorgroup by name;

7] retrieve total number of instructor
